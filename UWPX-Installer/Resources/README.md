# Resources
This folder should contain all required resources for sideloading your application.  
Therefore the `ReleaseInfo.json` configuration file is used.

By default the structure of this folder should look something like this:
```
├──> README.md                                      // This file.
├──> ReleaseInfo.json                               // General information and paths to the individual components.
├──> Packaging_0.23.0.0_x86_x64_arm.appxbundle      // The actual .appxbundle file that will be installed. This is generated by VS Compiler.
├──> Packaging_0.23.0.0_x86_x64_arm.cer             // The developer certificate that will be installed. This is generated by VS Compiler.
└──> Dependencies/                                  // All Dependencies required by .appxbundle. This is generated by VS Compiler.
     ├──> arm                                       // All ARM dependencies.
     |    ├──> *.msix                               // Dependency files that will be installed.
     |    └──> *.appx                               // Dependency files that will be installed.
     ├──> x64                                       // Dependency files that will be installed.
     |    ├──> *.msix                               // Dependency files that will be installed.

# ReleaseInfo.json
The `ReleaseInfo.json` file contains information required for installing your `.appxbundle`.
It supports the following configuration options:
* **certPath**: The relative path to the `.cert` file of your `.appxbundle`.
* **appxBundlePath**: The relative path to your `.appxbundle`.
* **dependeciesPath**: The relativ path to your `Dependencies` folder.
* **version**: A version string describing the current version of your `.appxbundle`
* **releaseDate**: The release date of this `.appxbundle`.
* **changelogUrl**: An URL to the changelog of the current version.
* **appFamilyName**: The apps family name. Can be found in your `Package.appxmanifest` in category `Packaging`  and section `Package family name:`.

Such a `ReleaseInfo.json` file could look like:
```JSON

  "certPath": "Packaging_0.23.0.0_x86_x64_arm.cer",
